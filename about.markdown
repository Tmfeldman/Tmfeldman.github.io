The most frusterating part of software development is spending hours on something which is easy, but poorly documented. In this blog I'll document the solutions I found to poorly documented problems as well as my own personal projects.

You can find some of my minecraft mods here:

[Enhanced Soul Speed](https://modrinth.com/mod/enhancedsoulspeed) \
[Point Blank Infinite Ammo](https://github.com/Tmfeldman/Forge1.21.1-PointBlank-Infinite-Ammo)

You can find the source code for my projects at GitHub:
